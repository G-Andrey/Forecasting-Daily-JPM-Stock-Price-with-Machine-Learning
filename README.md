## Goal :dart:
The ultimate goal of this project was to take a real-world problem and then attempt to solve it utilizing proper machine learning principles. The specific problem tackled is that of predicting future stock price movement using techincal analysis, framed as a forecasting machine learning problem. *Logistic regression*, *random forest classifier*, and *neural network* models were trained and tested on 7 years of historical $JPM data from 2012 - 2019.

## Skills Learned and Demonstrated
